            This project presents an AI-powered robotic hand system capable of
            real-time object detection and interaction through ultilizing the
            AMD-Xilinx KR260 FPGA platform. At its core, the system utilizes a
            hardware-accelerated YOLOv7 model running on the FPGAâ€™s{" "}
            <b>Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU)</b> to achieve efficient and
            low-latency visual recognition. The KR260 also integrates key
            interfaces such as I2C for peripheral communication and PWM for
            precise motor control. Upon detecting objects through its vision
            module, the robotic hand interprets the scene and executes
            appropriate gestures to grasp or interact with the object
            accordingly. This project showcases the fusion of edge AI, robotics,
            and FPGA-based acceleration for a responsive and intelligent
            automation application.
