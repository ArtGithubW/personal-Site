          Hi, Iâ€™m a computer engineer{" "}
          <b className="text-xs">(glorified software engineerðŸ˜…) </b>
          with a strong passion for improving everyday user experiences through
          technology. Originally born in Russia but proudly raised with
          Vietnamese roots, my journey in engineering has been shaped by a
          unique blend of cultural influences and an unwavering drive to solve
          real-world problems.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not immersed in code, I love winding down with games and my
          guitar. I also love relaxing by a campfire outdoors. Though I'm always
          up for trying out new experiences too~
          <br />
          <br />
          My approach to development is centered on prioritizing stability and
          simplicity while remaining open to continuous learning and
          improvement. I am always seeking new ways to enhance my skills and, in
          turn, elevate the user experience.
